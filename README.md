This is the main repository for assignment 4 on session management.

basic plan:

- simple website that would view a list of messages on the database.
- unauth user: cannot see message table on homepage
- auth user: can see message table on login
- "mod" superuser: can delete messages from message table
- frontend plan: one-column table that views messages submitted by users
